# 进程与线程


### 进程

 1. All the runnable software on the computer, sometimes including the operating system, is organized into a number of **sequential processes**, or just processes for short. **A process is just an instance of an executing program**.
 2. Processes must not be programmed with built-in assumptions about timing.
 3. The key idea here is that a process is an activity of some kind. It has a program, input, output, and a state. A single processor may be shared among several processes, with some scheduling algorithm being used to determine when to stop work on one process and service a different one.
 4. state
